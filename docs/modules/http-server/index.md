# @fehujs/http-server

This module contains the main features of a http server. It could be considered as the main module of the Fehujs project.

## Module configuration

In contrast of the other modules, http-server only needs to know the context of the application.

So you only have to set in your ``.env`` a ``NODE_ENV`` key that will store this context.

If this variable isn't "dev", "test", or "production", it will be set to "dev" and a log will warn you about this change.
